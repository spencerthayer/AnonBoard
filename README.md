#AnonBoard v0.5.1
An anonymous flat file image/text board designed to make crypto and security culture easy.

##How to Install
AnonBoard installation is extremely easy. Either clone the GitHub repository
`git clone https://github.com/spencerthayer/AnonBoard` or [download the zip](https://github.com/spencerthayer/AnonBoard/archive/master.zip) and extract it in the root directory of your site. As long as AnonBoard has read/write permissions and the `.htaccess` file has full mod rewrite capabilities for all directories everything should work out of the box.
