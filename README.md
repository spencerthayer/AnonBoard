# AnonBoard v0.9.1
An anonymous flat file image/text board designed to make crypto and security culture easy.

## WARNING: THIS IS NOT QUITE READY FOR PUBLIC USE!
While the basics of AnonBoard work to allow for anonymous communication the general UX/UI need improvement. With that said, AnonBoard is ready for public use but it isn't recommended. Please wait for version 1.0 which should be ready before Trump is impeached in office.

If you're in need of a working decentralized encrypted real time chat in which you have full control over the server please check out my other project [TorchNoteJS](https://github.com/spencerthayer/TorchNoteJS).
